			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				These country club potatoes are one of my favorite special-occasion side
				dishes. These perfectly tender potatoes have a luxurious texture and a
				rich flavor enhanced by first roasting the potatoes in broth. The
				ingredients are simple, but the techniques in this recipe produce the
				best potato gratin you'll ever have.
			</p>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>6 large russet potatoes (about 5 pounds)</li>
				<li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
				<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
				<li>1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
				<li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
				<li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
				<li>1/2 cup milk</li>
				<li>1/4 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
				<li>6 ounces Cheddar cheese, freshly grated</li>
				<li>sliced green onion, for garnishs</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
				<li>
					Peel, rinse, and cut potatoes in half lengthwise. Cut each half into 3
					strips, then cut across into 3/8-inch slices. Transfer slices into a
					large bowl of cold water and let sit for a few minutes to rinse off
					some of the starch. Transfer into a colander and rinse well; drain
					very well.
				</li>
				<li>
					Transfer potatoes to a 13x9-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle with salt,
					white pepper, and cayenne pepper; pour broth over and toss thoroughly
					with a spoon. Press everything down into an even layer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bake in the preheated oven until potato slices are just tender, about
					1 hour.
				</li>
				<li>
					Meanwhile, add breadcrumbs and butter to a small bowl; stir until the
					mixture resembles wet sand. Set aside. Mix milk and cream together;
					set aside.
				</li>
				<li>
					Remove potatoes from the oven and turn oven temperature up to 450
					degrees F (235 degrees C).
				</li>
				<li>
					Pour cream mixture over potatoes, and toss thoroughly with a spoon.
					Spread out again into an even layer. Scatter cheese evenly over the
					top, followed by breadcrumbs.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bake potatoes until browned and bubbling around the edges, about 20
					minutes more.
				</li>
				<li>
					Let stand for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with sliced green onions before
					serving.
				</li>
			</ol>
